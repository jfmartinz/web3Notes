# Lesson 1: Beyond Ethereum

## To Solidity and Beyond

Now that you have dipped your toes into the world of Solidity and Ethereum contracts, it's time to take things to the next level and explore new frontiers 🚀

One of the most powerful benefits of learning Solidity, and how to write Ethereum contracts, is that you can apply that knowledge towards other blockchains. Enter Avalanche - a fast, scalable, and highly secure blockchain that is taking the world by storm. With a growing list of enterprise clients, including the likes of Amazon, Avalanche is quickly becoming a leading player in the Web3 space.

In this module, you will learn how to leverage your Solidity knowledge and apply it to the Avalanche blockchain 🗻, unlocking new ways to improve performance, and drive innovation.

From decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Web3 landscape is exploding with creativity and potential. And with new blockchains like Avalanche entering the fray, the possibilities for growth and innovation are truly limitless. So strap in, buckle up, and get ready to take your Solidity skills to the next level - because your journey into Web3 and beyond has only just begun! 😎

## The Avalanche Revolution

So how is Avalanche built different? 🤔 The Avalanche blockchain aims to address the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security and decentralization. How you may ask? By having some of the most extreme scaling capabilities and fastest confirmation times in the industry. But what about security? Those speeds mean nothing if any bad actor can come in and work their villany! 🦹 Well, not to fear, because Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that picks validators at random to confirm transactions before they are finalized.

So how is all this raw power being used? As they say, the proof is in the pudding. Let’s take a look at some of the cool and innovative projects that have decided to call the Avalanche chain home.

### Avalanche for Good

Avalanche has demonstrated its potential to bring about positive change by enabling the creation of an insurance-like application for Kenyan farmers, built by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition 😇

This innovative solution allows farmers like Eunice Jesang to insure their crops for as low as $0.83, providing financial protection against climate-driven catastrophes. By utilizing the speed, reliability, and low fees of Avalanche, the application is able to offer policies at-cost, making it feasible to insure even small-scale farmers. The initiative, which has already helped 7,000 Kenyan farmers, showcases the transformative real-world potential of blockchain technology, as well as Avalanche's ability to solve previously unsolvable problems. This project, serving as a proof of concept, paves the way for further expansion and increased adoption of blockchain-based solutions, impacting the lives of millions of subsistence farmers across Africa and beyond. 🧑‍🌾👩‍🌾
