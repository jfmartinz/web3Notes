# Lesson 2: Real World Use Cases and dApps

## Introduction 
Congratulations on reaching the final lesson! Now that you have a solid understanding of how Ethereum and blockchains work, it's time to see how this technology is being applied in the real world to solve some of today's most pressing problems.

From decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management and even voting systems, Ethereum has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with each other and conduct business.

In this final lesson, we'll also explore some of the most popular decentralized applications (dApps) in the Ethereum ecosystem. These dApps are built on top of Ethereum and provide unique solutions for users across a variety of industries, from gaming to social media.

## So Who is Using Ethereum?

Blockchain technology and Ethereum, in particular, are revolutionizing the way companies approach business. Here are some real-world examples of how Ethereum is being used to create innovative solutions and solve real-world problems:

1. **Coca-Cola** is using Ethereum to improve supply chain management, ensuring transactions are tracked and verified in real-time. Imagine every bottle of Coca-Cola you purchase being tracked from the moment it's created until it reaches your hands!
2. **Microsoft** is using Ethereum to create decentralized identities for its users, giving them more privacy and security. Imagine having complete control over your digital identity and being able to securely manage it in a way that's never been possible before.
3. **JP Morgan** is using Ethereum to create their own blockchain platform called Quorum, which allows for more secure and efficient transaction processing. Imagine being able to conduct financial transactions faster and with greater transparency than ever before.
4. **ConsenSys** is using Ethereum to create decentralized applications across various industries, from finance to energy. Their solutions are aimed at reducing friction, increasing efficiency, and creating more transparent and equitable systems. Imagine being able to interact with companies and systems in a completely transparent and trustworthy way.
5. **Ubisoft** is using Ethereum to create blockchain-based gaming experiences, where players can truly own their in-game assets and have complete control over them. Imagine owning virtual items that have real-world value and being able to transfer them to other players or sell them for actual money!
   

These are just a few examples of the limitless potential of Ethereum and blockchain technology. By utilizing Ethereum, companies are able to create solutions that are more secure, efficient, and transparent than ever before, and we can expect to see more and more businesses jumping on board in the coming years. The future is looking bright for Ethereum and the blockchain revolution!

Next, we’ll take a look at two of the most popular types of dApps you’ll encounter, starting with DeFi and then ending with NFTs!


## What is DeFi?

DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is changing the way we think about money. Instead of relying on banks and other financial institutions, DeFi uses blockchain technology to allow people to lend, borrow, and trade directly with each other.

Ethereum is leading the way in DeFi, with a growing number of DeFi applications being built on the Ethereum network. In fact, the total value of assets locked in DeFi on Ethereum surpassed $100 billion in 2021, showing just how much demand there is for decentralized financial services.

DeFi is a game-changer for the financial industry, as it allows for more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial services. And as the adoption of blockchain technology continues to grow, we can expect DeFi to become even more popular and widespread.

## Non-Fungible Tokens

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that represent a specific item, such as a piece of art, a collectible, or a gaming item. They're different from cryptocurrencies, which are interchangeable.

NFTs have become popular in the art world, where artists can sell their digital creations directly to collectors without the need for intermediaries like galleries. NFTs also provide proof of ownership and authenticity, which is important in the digital world where it's easy to copy and reproduce art without permission.

In the gaming industry, NFTs are used to create player-owned economies. Game items like weapons, skins, and characters can be tokenized as NFTs, giving players true ownership and even allowing them to earn real money by selling their in-game assets to other players.

NFTs are a new and exciting development in the world of digital assets, with the potential to change the way we think about ownership and value in the digital world.

## Interoperability

Interoperability is a buzzword in the blockchain space, and Ethereum is no exception. Ethereum's open architecture and programmability make it a popular choice for building decentralized applications, but its ecosystem is also expanding beyond its own blockchain.

Interoperability is important for Ethereum because it enables greater collaboration and innovation among different blockchain networks. For example, Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has been able to expand thanks to bridges that connect Ethereum to other blockchains, such as the Binance Smart Chain and the Polygon Network.

Additionally, Ethereum-based projects are working on interoperability solutions to connect with other blockchain networks. For example, the Polkadot project is building a platform that allows for the transfer of assets and data between different blockchains, including Ethereum.

Interoperability is an exciting development for Ethereum and the wider blockchain industry, as it opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications and asset transfer. As the blockchain space continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how interoperability evolves and shapes the future of decentralized technology.

## Bridges

Ethereum can't do everything on its own, but as you just learned about interoperability, you know it doesn't have to! Enter bridges, the handy connectors that allow Ethereum to talk to other blockchain networks. Bridges make it possible to exchange value and information between different blockchains, opening up new possibilities for innovation and collaboration. Without them, Ethereum would be a lot less useful and powerful.

Bridges are not limited to blockchain networks, they can also connect to other technologies. For instance, Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and has been integrated with several blockchain bridges. This allows Ethereum-based applications to access off-chain data and trigger smart contract actions accordingly.

Overall, bridges are an important component of the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling interoperability and innovation between different networks and technologies. As blockchain continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more powerful bridges connecting different blockchains and enabling new use cases.
