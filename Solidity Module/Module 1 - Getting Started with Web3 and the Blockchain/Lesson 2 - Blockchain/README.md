# Lesson 2: Blockchain

## Introduction

Now that you have learned about web3, let's take things a step further.

In this lesson, we will learn more about what the blockchain is and what makes it unique. Along the way, we will talk about *cryptography* and what that has to do with the *blockchain*.

This will be a great lesson to set the context for everything to come. We know knowledge about web3 and the blockchain is a foundational skill, so let's get started!

## Understanding the Blockchain

At the heart of web3, is the **blockchain**. As you learned in the last lesson, this is like a huge spreadsheet shared by everyone. The fancy name for this is **distributed ledger technology**.

How's this different from web2?

Unlike web2 technology, which relies on a centralized server that can be easily hacked or manipulated, web3 uses a decentralized and distributed database called a blockchain. This means that transactions are validated by numerous nodes and stored in a ledger that is accessible by everyone, making it almost impossible for anyone to hack or manipulate the system.

To make sure that transactions are valid and accurate, they are confirmed and sealed into a block using advanced cryptographic software tools. Each block is identified by a unique hash and linked to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks containing transaction records. It's like a digital version of a "trust fall" - thousands of nodes are working together to make sure that everyone stays safe and accurate.

So, if you're tired of worrying about data breaches and hacks, web3 technology and the blockchain might just be the solution you've been waiting for. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaTqdCgbk7Y) to see a visual representation of how it all works! ðŸ‘€

## Coordinating Across the Blockchain

Picture a group of rowdy kids all vying for attention, shouting over one another, and going in different directions. Now, imagine trying to get thousands of unknown parties to work together on a project in a way that's fair, secure, and efficient. That's what blockchain technology does, and it's a fascinating feat.

The secret to making it work is a process called *consensus*. It's like a giant game of "Simon Says" that all the computers on the network play. They all have to agree on the rules and execute them precisely. There are two types of consensus mechanisms, and Ethereum just switched from one to the other.

The old one, called **Proof of Work** (PoW), is like a competitive puzzle-solving contest where miners race to solve complex mathematical problems to earn rewards. The catch is that the puzzles are designed to be increasingly difficult, and the more people mining, the harder they get. This means that miners need expensive equipment and lots of electricity, creating an inefficient and environmentally-unfriendly system.

The new mechanism, **Proof of Stake** (PoS), is like a team sport where validators are incentivized to work together to keep the network secure. Instead of racing to solve puzzles, validators stake their own cryptocurrency and are rewarded for following the rules and penalized for misbehavior. This creates a more sustainable and cost-effective system, with fewer barriers to entry.

Switching from PoW to PoS was a big move for Ethereum, but it shows the platform's commitment to innovation and sustainability. By using consensus mechanisms like PoS, Ethereum is creating a system where everyone can play nicely together, creating a more collaborative and efficient future for blockchain technology.

## Cryptography 101
Welcome now to the exciting world of cryptography! It's a fundamental concept that's essential to understanding web3 and its underlying technologies.

Cryptography is all about keeping information safe and secure, whether it's your personal data or financial transactions. It's the backbone of all modern communication systems, from banking to e-commerce to social media.

In this lesson, and the lessons ahead, you'll learn about the foundational concepts of cryptography, including encryption, decryption, keys, and hashes. This knowledge will help you better understand how data is secured in the blockchain and how cryptocurrencies are kept safe from prying eyes and hackers.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid grasp of cryptography and be ready to take your first steps into the exciting world of web3!

## Hashing on the Blockchain

Hashing on the blockchain may sound like a mundane task, but it's actually a fascinating process that makes the entire system work.

Hashing is the backbone of the blockchain. It's the magic that turns any data, no matter how large or small, into a unique string of characters that can never be replicated. This string of characters is called a hash, and it's an essential component of how the blockchain stores and verifies information.

Hashing is a process of using a mathematical algorithm to transform any kind of data, from a simple text message to an entire movie file, into a unique string of characters. The hash function takes this data and runs it through a complex calculation, resulting in a hash that is unique to that specific piece of information.

But why is this important for the blockchain?

Because the hash is unique, it can be used to verify that the information hasn't been tampered with or changed. Each block in the blockchain contains a hash of the previous block, creating an unbreakable chain of data that can be traced back to the beginning of the chain.

This makes the blockchain incredibly secure and resistant to fraud. Even if someone were to try and change a single piece of information in the blockchain, it would result in a completely different hash, breaking the chain and alerting the network to a problem.

So, while hashing may seem like a small piece of the puzzle, it's actually a critical component of the blockchain's security and integrity.

## SHA-256
In this [video](https://youtu.be/S5wI1s4Kaf4), we're going to unlock the secrets of one of the most widely used hashing functions in the world of cryptocurrencies - SHA-256. Developed by the US National Security Agency, this secure hashing algorithm ensures the safety and accuracy of transactions in the Bitcoin network, and is a vital component of the blockchain's security.

## Challenge

This lesson's challenge is a chance for you to experiment with hashing and the blockchain with two different tools.

First, visit the [SHA-256 Hash Generator](https://academo.org/demos/SHA-256-hash-generator/). Try entering different text and see how it hashes your text.

Then, visit the online [blockchain simulator](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash). There are six different simulations to experiment with along the top:

- Hash
- Block
- Blockchain
- Distributed
- Tokens
- Coinbase
