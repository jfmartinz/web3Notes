# Lesson 3: Arrays, Structs, Mapping, Gas and Conditional Statements

## Arrays in Solidity
We’ll start by watching arrays in action, and then by the end of the lesson, you can do the coding! This [video](https://youtu.be/vTxxCbwMPwo) will up your game and teach you all the ways to integrate arrays in your code.

## Structs in Solidity

Now let's mix in some [structs!](https://youtu.be/pQJ4TeHifdk) Just like the last video, we will start by watching how structs are used inside a contract. Later, it will be your turn to code.

## Mapping in Solidity

Now that you know about structs. Let's sprinkle in a little [mapping](https://youtu.be/Q-wRG7pngn0) to wrap things up with our user-defined variables. This will be important later in the lesson when you will use mapping yourself, so make sure to pay attention. 

## Decoding Gas

Gas is an important concept with Ethereum.

It seems complex, but it’s really just a unit of computation. Every transaction that happens occurs at the network level, so we have to pay the network its due to complete the computation.

Put simply, gas tells us how much we have to pay for our amazing code to do what it was born to do.

Let's learn more about how to decode gas in this [video](https://youtu.be/oTS9uxU6cAM)<br>

## Conditional Statements

Just one last concept. It's a lot of information at once, I know, but we will start to implement all this knowledge in the next lesson.

In this [video](https://youtu.be/Ld8bFWXLSfs), you’ll see some conditional statements in action so you’ll know how to use them in your own code.
