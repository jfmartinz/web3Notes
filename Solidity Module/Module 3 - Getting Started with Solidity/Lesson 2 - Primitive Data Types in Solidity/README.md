# Lesson 2: Primitive Data Types in Solidity

## Introduction to Data Types with Examples

### Introduction and Code Example

A data type is an attribute of data that tells the compiler how the programmer intends to use the data. You got a sneak peek of this in the last lesson, but now we‚Äôll go just a little deeper.

Confusing? Don't worry, we got you fam üëç In this [video](https://youtu.be/8Tj-Th_S7NU), you‚Äôll learn all about the different data types and what you need to know.

## Constants, Ether, and Wei

### Constants

Coding on the Ethereum blockchain means we have to think about gas. How much does it cost, and how can we save money?

Constants can help us! Have a variable that you set once, and it never changes? You just found yourself a prime candidate for a constant!

Here's what you need to know. Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/y5uiQ9IJhMc)<br>

## Ether and Wei

The smallest unit of ether is called a wei , and there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei in one ether (x18 decimal zeros 0 s = 1 quintillion). To make it as simple as possible, we can break down ether units into two parts on both sides: smaller and larger units.
