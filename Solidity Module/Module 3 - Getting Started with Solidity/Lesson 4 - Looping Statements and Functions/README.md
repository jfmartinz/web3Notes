# Lesson 4: Looping Statements and Functions

## Looping Statements

This lesson is an important one because loops will save you a LOT of time coding. Loops allow you to write code once and then repeat it as many times as you want..Cool, right?

Let's see how itâ€™s used in this [video](https://youtu.be/SB705OK3bUg).


## Functions in Solidity

Don't worry, we're not done yet!

Now we're going to learn a little bit more about functions.

## Functions in Action

This code-along [video](https://youtu.be/Mm6834AAY00) will now show you how functions can be added to your code. This will prepare you for the challenge coming up next. Watch closely, and feel free to come back to this video if you need help creating your functions.
